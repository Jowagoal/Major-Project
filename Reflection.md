# Major Project Reflection

- Working alone


- There were two problems that I could not solve.  The first was some wierd glitch where certain words and buttons would dissapear at a very certain resolution.  The second was after playing a single round in any gamemode, the stroke disappeared.  These things were extremely odd and I tried my best to fix them.
- One of the hardest problems was getting the Ai to work.  This wasn't even something that I wanted to do until late into this project, I got an idea on how to make it work and I tried it.  There were many problems along the way such as incorrect labeling of positions, looping, and resizing the board.
- All of which were solved more or less.  Every now and then I still see the Ai get stuck in a loop and it is always near the beginning of the run or right before the snake beats the track. However, it is still an Ai that I am proud of.
- if I were to do it again, I would probably want to think about the overall program from the beginning.  I ran into many problems where I had to restructure large portions of code, if I had thought about certain things I wouldn't have written the code the way I did.
- I completed all the need to have things in my list before most started their final project, so I spent a lot of my time adding things I really wanted to add, such as two player, game sizes, and ai.
